<h1 id="alignment-based-metrics">Alignment-based metrics</h1>
<p>This post is the first in a series about assessing similarity between time series. More specifically, we will be interested in <em>alignment-based metrics</em>,<label for="sn-1" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label> <input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="sidenote-toggle" /> <span class="sidenote">Here we use the term &#x201C;metrics&#x201D; in a pretty unformal manner, that is an equivalent of &#x201C;similarity measure&#x201D;.</span> that rely on a temporal alignment of the series in order to assess their similarity.</p>
<p>Before entering into more details about these metrics, let us define our base objects: time series. In the following, a time series is a sequence of features: <span class="math inline">\(x = (x_0, \dots, x_{n-1})\)</span>. All features from a time series lie in the same space <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^p\)</span>. Below is an example univariate<label for="sn-2" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label> <input type="checkbox" id="sn-2" class="sidenote-toggle" /> <span class="sidenote">A time series is said univariate if all its feature vectors are monodimensional (<span class="math inline">\(p=1\)</span>).</span> time series:</p>

<figcaption>
Example univariate time series. The horizontal axis is the time axis and the vertical one is dedicated to (univariate) feature values.

</figure>
<p>Let us now illustrate the typical behavior of alignment-based metrics with an example.</p>
<figure>
<img src="fig/dtw_vs_euc.svg" alt="DTW vs Euclidean distance" width="100%" />
<figcaption>
Comparison between DTW and Euclidean distance. Note that, for the sake of visualization, time series are shifted vertically, but one should imagine that feature value ranges (y-axis values) match.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Here, we are computing similarity between two time series using either Euclidean distance (left) or Dynamic Time Warping (DTW, right), which is an instance of alignment-based metric that we will present in more details later in this post. In both cases, the returned similarity is the sum of distances between matched features.<label for="sn-match" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label> <input type="checkbox" id="sn-match" class="sidenote-toggle" /> <span class="sidenote">Here, matches are represented by gray lines and the distance associated to a match between <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>-th feature in time series <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>-th feature in time series <span class="math inline">\(x^\prime\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(d(x_i, x^\prime_j)\)</span>.</span> Note how DTW matches distinctive patterns of the time series, which is likely to result in a more sound similarity assessment than when using Euclidean distance that matches timestamps regardless of the feature values.</p>
<p>Now let us see how this property translates in a machine learning setting. Suppose we are given the following unlabelled time series dataset:</p>
<figure>
<video playsinline muted autoplay controls loop width="80%">
<source src="fig/dataset_viz.webm" type="video/webm" />
<source src="fig/dataset_viz.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
<img src="fig/dataset_viz.gif" alt="A time series dataset" /> </video>
<figcaption>
A time series dataset.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If you look carefully at this dataset, you might notice that there are three families of series in it. Let us see if a classical clustering algorithm can detect these three typical shapes. To do so, we will use the <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-means algorithm, which aims at forming clusters as compact as possible with respect to a given similarity metric. By default the metric is Euclidean distance, which gives, in our example:</p>
<figure>
<img src="fig/kmeans_euc.svg" alt="$k$-means clustering with Euclidean distance" width="100%" />
<figcaption>
Euclidean <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-means clustering of the dataset presented in Figure 3. Each subfigure represents series from a given cluster and their centroid (in orange).
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As one can see, this is not fully satisfactory. First, Cluster 2 mixes two distinct time series shapes. Second, the barycenters for each cluster are not especially representative of the time series gathered in the clusters. Even Cluster 1, which seems to be the &#x201C;purest&#x201D; one, suffers from this last pitfall, since the local oscillations that are observed towards the end of the series have a lower magnitude in the reconstructed barycenter than in the series themselves.</p>
<p>Let us now switch to Dynamic Time Warping as the core metric for our <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-means algorithm. The resulting clusters are this time closer to what one could expect:</p>
<figure>
<img src="fig/kmeans_dtw.svg" alt="$k$-means clustering with DTW" width="100%" />
<figcaption>
DTW <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-means clustering of the dataset presented in Figure 3. Each subfigure represents series from a given cluster and their centroid (in orange).
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This is because time series in each group are very similar <strong>up to a time shift</strong>, which is a known invariant of Dynamic Time Warping, as we will see.</p>
<h1 id="dynamic-time-warping">Dynamic Time Warping</h1>
<p>We will now review Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) in more details. DTW is a similarity measure between time series which has been introduced independently in the literature by <span class="citation" data-cites="vintsyuk1968speech">[<a href="#ref-vintsyuk1968speech" role="doc-biblioref">Vint68</a>]</span> and <span class="citation" data-cites="sakoe1978dynamic">[<a href="#ref-sakoe1978dynamic" role="doc-biblioref">SaCh78</a>]</span>, in both cases for speech applications.<label for="sn-3" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label> <input type="checkbox" id="sn-3" class="sidenote-toggle" /> <span class="sidenote">Note that, in this series of posts, we will stick to the formalism from <span class="citation" data-cites="sakoe1978dynamic">[<a href="#ref-sakoe1978dynamic" role="doc-biblioref">SaCh78</a>]</span>, which is more standard in the literature.</span></p>
<p>Let us consider two time series <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({x}^\prime\)</span> of respective lengths <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>. Here, all elements <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x^\prime_j\)</span> are assumed to lie in the same <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-dimensional space and the exact timestamps at which observations occur are disregarded: only their ordering matters.</p>
<p>Dynamic Time Warping seeks for the temporal alignment<label for="sn-temp-align" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label> <input type="checkbox" id="sn-temp-align" class="sidenote-toggle" /> <span class="sidenote">A temporal alignment is a matching between time indexes of the two time series.</span> that minimizes Euclidean distance between aligned series, as illustrated in the Figure below:</p>
<figure>
<video playsinline muted autoplay controls loop width="60%">
<source src="fig/dtw_path.webm" type="video/webm" />
<source src="fig/dtw_path.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
<img src="fig/dtw_path.gif" alt="DTW as minimum Euclidean distance up to a realignment" /> </video>
<figcaption>
Dynamic Time Warping is equivalent to minimizing Euclidean distance between aligned time series under all admissible temporal alignments. Cyan dots correspond to repetitions of time series elements induced by the optimal temporal alignment retrieved by DTW. Note how, once inserted these repeated elements, all matchings become vertical, which is the typical behavior of Euclidean distance, as shown in Figure 2.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2 id="problem-formulation">Problem formulation</h2>
<p>More formally, the optimization problem writes:</p>
<p><span id="eq:dtw" class="eqnos"><span class="math display">\[DTW_q({x}, {x}^\prime) =
    \min_{\pi \in \mathcal{A}({x}, {x}^\prime)}
        \left( \sum_{(i, j) \in \pi} d(x_i, x^\prime_j)^q \right)^{\frac{1}{q}}
\]</span><span class="eqnos-number">(1)</span></span> </p>
<p>Here, an <strong>alignment path</strong> <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> of length <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is a sequence of <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> index pairs <span class="math inline">\(\left((i_0, j_0), \dots , (i_{K-1}, j_{K-1})\right)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}({x}, {x}^\prime)\)</span> is the set of all admissible paths. In order to be considered admissible, a path should satisfy the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Beginning (resp. end) of time series are matched together:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\pi_0 = (0, 0)\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\pi_{K-1} = (n - 1, m - 1)\)</span></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The sequence is monotonically increasing in both <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> and all time series indexes should appear at least once, which can be written:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(i_{k-1} \leq i_k \leq i_{k-1} + 1\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(j_{k-1} \leq j_k \leq j_{k-1} + 1\)</span></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="dot-product-notation">Dot product notation</h3>
<p>Another way to represent a DTW path is to use a binary matrix whose non-zero entries are those corresponding to a matching between time series elements. This representation is related to the index sequence representation used above through:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
(A_\pi)_{i,j} = \left\{ \begin{array}{rl} 1 &amp; \text{ if } (i, j) \in \pi \\
                                      0 &amp; \text{ otherwise}
                        \end{array} \right. .
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>This is illustrated in the Figure below where nonzero entries in the binary matrix are represented as dots and the equivalent sequence of matchings is produced on the right:</p>
<figure>
<img src="fig/dtw_path_matrix.svg" alt="DTW path as a matrix" width="100%" />
<figcaption>
Dynamic Time Warping path represented as a binary matrix. (Left) Each dot on the path indicates a nonzero entry in <span class="math inline">\(A_\pi\)</span>, hence the matching of an element in <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> with an element in <span class="math inline">\(x^\prime\)</span>. Note the correspondence between this representation and the one on the right.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Using matrix notation, Dynamic Time Warping can be written as the minimization of a dot product between matrices:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*}
DTW_q({x}, {x}^\prime) =
    \min_{\pi \in \mathcal{A}({x}, {x}^\prime)}
        \left\langle A_\pi,  D_q({x}, {x}^\prime) \right\rangle^{\frac{1}{q}}
\end{equation*}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(D_q({x}, {x}^\prime)\)</span> stores distances <span class="math inline">\(d(x_i, x^\prime_j)\)</span> at the power <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="algorithmic-solution">Algorithmic Solution</h2>
<p>Though the optimization problem in Eq.&#xA0;<a href="#eq:dtw">(1)</a> is minimization over a finite set, the number of admissible paths (coined <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delannoy_number">Delannoy number</a>) becomes very large even for moderate time series lengths. Assuming <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> are the same order, there exists <span class="math inline">\(O\left(\frac{(3 + 2\sqrt{2})^n}{\sqrt{n}}\right)\)</span> different paths in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}(x, x^\prime)\)</span>, which makes it intractable to actually list all paths sequentially in order to compute the minimum.</p>
<p>Fortunately, an exact solution to this optimization problem can be found using dynamic programming. Dynamic programming relies on recurrence. The essence of recurrence is to link the solution of a given problem to solutions of (easier) sub-problems. Once this link is known, the dynamic programming approach consists in solving the original problem by recursively solving required sub-problems and storing their solutions for later use (so as not to re-compute subproblems several times).</p>
<p>In the case of DTW, we need to rely on the following quantity:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
    R_{i,j} = DTW_q({x}_{\rightarrow i}, {x}^\prime_{\rightarrow j})^q
\]</span></p>
<p>where the notation <span class="math inline">\({x}_{\rightarrow i}\)</span> denotes time series <span class="math inline">\({x}\)</span> observed up to timestamp <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> (included). Then, we can observe that:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
R_{i,j} 
    &amp;= \min_{\pi \in \mathcal{A}({x}_{\rightarrow i}, {x}^\prime_{\rightarrow j})}
        \sum_{(k, l) \in \pi} d(x_k, x^\prime_l)^q \\
    &amp;\stackrel{*}{=} d(x_i, x^\prime_j)^q +
        \min_{\pi \in \mathcal{A}({x}_{\rightarrow i}, {x}^\prime_{\rightarrow j})}
            \sum_{(k, l) \in \pi[:-1]} d(x_k, x^\prime_l)^q \\
    &amp;\stackrel{**}{=} d(x_i, x^\prime_j)^q +
        \min ({\color{MidnightBlue}R_{i-1, j}}, {\color{Red}R_{i, j-1}}, {\color{ForestGreen}R_{i-1, j-1}})
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\((*)\)</span> comes from the constraints on admissible paths <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>: the last element on an admissible path needs to match the last elements of the series. Also, <span class="math inline">\((**)\)</span> results from the contiguity conditions on the admissible paths. Indeed, a path that would align time series <span class="math inline">\({x}_{\rightarrow i}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({x}^\prime_{\rightarrow j}\)</span> necessarily encapsulates either:</p>
<ul>
<li>a path that would align time series <span class="math inline">\({x}_{\rightarrow i - 1}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({x}^\prime_{\rightarrow j}\)</span>, or</li>
<li>a path that would align time series <span class="math inline">\({x}_{\rightarrow i}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({x}^\prime_{\rightarrow j - 1}\)</span>, or</li>
<li>a path that would align time series <span class="math inline">\({x}_{\rightarrow i - 1}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({x}^\prime_{\rightarrow j - 1}\)</span>,</li>
</ul>
<p>as illustrated in the Figure below:</p>
<figure>
<img src="fig/dtw_transitions.svg" alt="DTW transitions" width="50%" />

</figure>
<p>This implies that filling a matrix that would store <span class="math inline">\(R_{i,j}\)</span> terms row-by-row<label for="sn-row-wise" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label> <input type="checkbox" id="sn-row-wise" class="sidenote-toggle" /> <span class="sidenote">In practice, the matrix could be filled column-by-column too. The important part is that the terms <span class="math inline">\(R_{i-1, j}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(R_{i, j-1}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(R_{i-1, j-1}\)</span> are accessible when computing <span class="math inline">\(R_{i, j}\)</span>. When vectorizing code is of importance, an even better strategy is to compute the <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> terms one anti-diagonal at a time <span class="citation" data-cites="tralie2020exact">[<a href="#ref-tralie2020exact" role="doc-biblioref">TrDe20</a>]</span>.</span> is sufficient to retrieve <span class="math inline">\(DTW_q({x}, {x}^\prime)\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\({R_{n-1, m-1}}^{\frac{1}{q}}\)</span>.</p>
<p>These observations result in the following <span class="math inline">\(O(mn)\)</span> algorithm to compute the exact optimum for DTW (assuming computation of <span class="math inline">\(d(\cdot,\cdot)\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(O(1)\)</span>):</p>
<pre>
  <code class="language-python">
def dtw(x, x_prime, q=2):
  for i in range(len(x)):
    for j in range(len(x_prime)):
      R[i, j] = d(x[i], x_prime[j]) ** q
      if i > 0 or j > 0:
        R[i, j] += min(
          R[i-1, j  ] if i > 0             else inf,
          R[i  , j-1] if j > 0             else inf,
          R[i-1, j-1] if (i > 0 and j > 0) else inf
          # Note that these 3 terms cannot all be 
          # inf if we have (i > 0 or j > 0)
        )

  return R[-1, -1] ** (1. / q)
  </code>
</pre>
<h2 id="properties">Properties</h2>
<p>Dynamic Time Warping holds a few of the basic metric properties, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(DTW_q({x}, {x}^\prime) \geq 0\)</span> for any time series <span class="math inline">\({x}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({x}^\prime\)</span>;</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(DTW_q({x}, {x}) = 0\)</span> for any time series <span class="math inline">\({x}\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, mathematically speaking, DTW is not a valid metric since it satisfies neither the triangular inequality nor the identity of indiscernibles. More specifically, DTW is invariant to time shifts. In other words, if <span class="math inline">\({x}\)</span> is a time series that is constant except for a motif that occurs at some point in the series, and if <span class="math inline">\({x}_{+k}\)</span> is a copy of <span class="math inline">\({x}\)</span> in which the motif is temporally shifted by <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> timestamps, then <span class="math inline">\(DTW_q({x}, {x}_{+k}) = 0\)</span>, as illustrated below:</p>

</figure>
<h2 id="setting-additional-constraints">Setting Additional Constraints</h2>
<p>As we have seen, Dynamic Time Warping is invariant to time shifts, whatever their magnitude. In order to allow invariances to local deformations only, one can impose additional constraints on the set of admissible paths.</p>
<p>Such constraints typically translate into enforcing nonzero entries in <span class="math inline">\(A_\pi\)</span> to stay close to the diagonal. The Sakoe-Chiba band <span class="citation" data-cites="sakoe1978dynamic">[<a href="#ref-sakoe1978dynamic" role="doc-biblioref">SaCh78</a>]</span> is a constant-width band parametrized by a radius <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> (also called warping window size sometimes) Another standard global constraint is the Itakura parallelogram <span class="citation" data-cites="itakura1975minimum">[<a href="#ref-itakura1975minimum" role="doc-biblioref">Itak75</a>]</span> sets a maximum slope <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> for alignment paths, which leads to a parallelogram-shaped constraint. The impact of these parameters is illustrated in the Figure below:</p>
<figure>
<video playsinline muted autoplay controls loop width="45%">

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Setting global constraints on admissible DTW paths is equivalent to restricting the set of possible matches for each element in a time series. The number of possible matches for an element is always <span class="math inline">\(2r+1\)</span> for Sakoe-Chiba constraints (except for border elements), while it varies depending on the time index for Itakura parallelograms:</p>

<figcaption>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As stated above, setting such constraints leads to restricting the shift invariance to local shifts only. Typically, DTW with a Sakoe-Chiba band constraint of radius <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is invariant to time shifts of magnitude up to <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>, but is no longer invariant to longer time shifts:</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>We have seen in this post how alignment-based metrics can prove useful when dealing with temporally shifted time series. We have presented in more details the most common of these metrics, which is Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). If you enjoyed this post, stay tuned, a new one should be published soon on the specific topic of the differentiability of DTW.</p>
